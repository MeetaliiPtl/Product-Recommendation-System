# Product-Recommendation-System
 A product recommendation system is a type of technology that analyzes user data to provide personalized product suggestions. However, in cases where there is no user-item purchase history available, textual clustering analysis can be used as an alternative approach to generate recommendations. 
Textual clustering analysis is a process that involves grouping together products with similar descriptions based on the language used in the product description. This approach involves analyzing the text in the product descriptions, and identifying patterns and similarities between the descriptions. By doing so, products can be clustered together based on their shared attributes and characteristics. Once the clustering analysis is completed, the product recommendation system can suggest products to users based on their preferences. For example, if a user is interested in purchasing a new phone, the system can recommend phones that are similar to the ones that they have shown interest in, based on the characteristics identified through the clustering analysis. These recommendations can be made in real-time, as users browse the website, or through targeted marketing campaigns. Overall, a product recommendation system based on textual clustering analysis can be an effective tool for businesses looking to provide personalized product recommendations to their customers. By analyzing product descriptions and clustering similar products together, businesses can provide tailored recommendations to customers based on their interests, even if there is no purchase history available.
